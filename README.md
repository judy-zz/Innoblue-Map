Innoblue Map
============

A force-directed graph describing the way Innoblue operates.

I use Guard to automatically convert Coffeescript, Haml and Sass into their respective JS, HTML and CSS files. I've also included the entire D3 library for further play. Running `./create_data.rb` will automatically convert hackermap.yml into the necessary format (public/hackermap.json) for D3.js.
